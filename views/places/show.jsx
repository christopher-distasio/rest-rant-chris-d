//Unlike the edit.jsx file, the show.jsx file here isn't using destructuring in order to show you how props are used. 

//(Normally you would be consistent and use destructuring in both since it's a good practice to use destructuring 
//when you can and developers on the job will know it and probably expect to see it.)

//What is props? Props is an object that is passed into a function. It contains all the data that is passed into the function.
//It's like a super object that contains all the data (with all the specific objects with their key-value pairs (such as
//place: name, place: pic, etc.) that are passed into a function (such as show in this case). 

//You don't have to use the word props per se, you can use any word you want, but props is the convention word to use/call the
//super object that contains all the data that is passed into a function. For example, you could use the word data, or
//superObject, or even "fluffy", but you just shouldn't :)
