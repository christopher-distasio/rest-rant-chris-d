

With this activity, your team must have one member 
showing their screen and the other two members actively discussing each of the questions 
in each file.

When the process is finished with one student, go to the next student until all code is fixed
and questions answered. Copy each other's answers into your own code.

You'll need to make your own repo for it if you'd like to store it on Github.
